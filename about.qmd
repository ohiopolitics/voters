**We're all** data scientists who enjoy finding stories in unexpected places and opening up information to the public. We've worked at political consulting companies and studied political elections from the ground up, and want to share what we've learned.

**Spencer Driggs** is a data science student at BYU-Idaho. He currently works as a data journalist for *Scroll*, BYU-I's newspaper, and as a data scientist for the Wilford Woodruff Papers Project. When he's not making charts or building stories, he enjoys playing clarinet and reading strange books. He hopes someday he'll write data pieces like [Jon Bois](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlviajJlctQ&t=293s&pp=ygUKZGF2ZSBzdGVpYg%3D%3D) can.
